# Classifications_using_KNN
Classifications using K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm.
KNN- K nearest neighbors are one of the widely used algorithm in the field of Machine Learning. 
This method does not go with actual training of a model, rather this is prediction analysis using metics such as distances.
  The distance metrics can be of Euclidean, Minowski, SEuclidean, Mahalanobis and many more, which can be used based on the requirement.
