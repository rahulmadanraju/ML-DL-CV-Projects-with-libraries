# Project Invisible ##

The project is similar to an housing video frames for green backgorund as we see in recording stations. The foreground is masked and background is replaced based on the requirement. 

The logic here is quite opposite to the one mentioned above. In our case we will be masking the backgorund and replacing it to the foreground for a selective color. 

Here we implement the project for red, blue and any color to one's requirement.

## Requirements:

- Python > 3.5

- OpenCV3

## Procedure:
Follow the steps moentioned under to make an implementation of project invisible.

  1. The required libraries are imported
  2. Once the video is started, record and store the background
  3. Based on your requirement, cast the color to be invisible and detect it in the video frames
  4. Once the color is casted, try to replace the color with background frame
  5. Make a live demo
  
  The detailed explanation is given in the blog mentioned in the reference.
  
  The sample of the video is as shown:
